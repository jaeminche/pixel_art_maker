# Pixel Art Maker Project

I built a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas!
I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and speaking of JavaScript code, it let the user to create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a drawing.
